/*
**	Shell Subsystems
**	Other subsystems that complete your shell are:
**		● Environment Variables: Expressions of the form ${VAR} are expanded
**		with the corresponding environment variable. Also the shell should be
**		able to set, expand and print environment vars.
**		● Wildcards: Arguments of the form a*a are expanded to all the files
**		that match them in the local directory and in multiple directories .
**		● Subshells: Arguments between `` (backticks) are executed and the
**		output is sent as input to the shell.
